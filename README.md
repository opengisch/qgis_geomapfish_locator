# Geomapfish Locator Plugin
A QGIS 3 locator plugin for Geomapfish services

## Quick start Guide

Go to `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install Plugins` and search for Geomapfish Locator

Install the plugin

`Settings` -> `Options` -> `Locator` and open the configuration dialog for `Geomapfish Locator`

Set the parameters of your service :

* Name of the filter (e.g. MysearchService)

* URL (e.g. https://www.myservice.com/search)

* CRS (e.g. EPSG 21781)

Validate and start search in the locator bar at the bottom left of the application.

If you want to avoid typing the prefix of the filter (`gmf`), enable it by default in the locator bar settings.
