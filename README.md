# Geomapfish Locator Plugin
A QGIS 3 locator plugin for Geomapfish services

## Quick start Guide

Go to `Plugins` -> `Manage and Install Plugins`, look for Geomapfish Locator and install the plugin.

`Settings` -> `Options` -> `Locator` and open the configuration dialog for `Geomapfish Locator`

Add a new service from the plugin menu entry (`Plugins`-> `Geomapfish Locator Filters` -> `Add new service`)

Validate and start searching in the locator bar at the bottom left of the application.

## Advanced configuration

Each service will create its own locator filter. All the filters can be seen under the locator settings 
(in `Settings` -> `Options` -> `Locator`) and can be configured from there, including the prefix configuration.
If you want to avoid typing the prefix of the filter (`gmf`), enable the filter by default.
